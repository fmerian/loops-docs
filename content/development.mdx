Follow these steps to install and run Mintlify on your operating system:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Mintlify">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash npm
      npm i -g mintlify
      ```
      ```bash yarn
      yarn global add mintlify
      ```
    </CodeGroup><br/>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run ">
    Navigate to the docs directory (where the mint.json file is located) and execute the following command:

    ```bash
    mintlify dev
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting
